## Triangle Tracker
#### A website that is able to tell it's users what type of triangle they have once they input 3 values.
## By Francis Mwangi. December 1st 2018
## Description
The website is a triangle tracker that allows users to identify(track) what type of triangle they have using the 3 lengths present in a triangle. The user inputs 3 values in the three prompts (x,y,z) and the website tells them whether the values would be viable for an isosceles triangle, an equilateral triangle, a scalene triangle or wouldn't make a triangle at all(not a triangle). The user is required to input 3 numerical values (the three sides of the triangle and the website will tell them what kind of a triangle it is and explain why as well.) However as of now the website can only identify three types of triangle (an isosceles triangle, an equilateral triangle, a scalene triangle) and also tell a user if the values can't form a triangle. Future iterations should have more capabilities on this feature.It's also important to note that the values a user inputs have to be in numeric form and can't be in alphanumeric or alphabetic form. In short the user has to enter numbers and can't put numbers in the form of words(an example would be "thirty") as this will not work for now.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The websites URL -https://njarif.github.io/Triangle-tracker/
* A working internet connection.
* Values (integers) to test.
* As it's a simple website, there are no dependancies, databases to set up or any other code required to run the site.
